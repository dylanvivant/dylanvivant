🚀 About Me

**I am a junior frontend developer.** 🧑‍💻

*I primarily develop websites. You can find all my projects here.*

I only recently started in web development, so I am quite a new developer, yet I am already passionate about this field. I am interested in pursuing creative development in the future. I am currently looking for my first job, so if you would like to collaborate with me, please send me an email.
